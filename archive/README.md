# Archived Files

This directory contains JavaScript files that were archived during the code consolidation process.

**Archive Date:** 2025-10-30T08:42:56.082Z
**Total Files Archived:** 60

## Directory Structure

- **development/** - Mock implementations and development utilities
- **testing/** - Testing and debugging tools
- **experimental/** - Experimental features and prototypes
- **specialized/** - Specialized systems (conjugators, verb packs, etc.)
- **old-versions/** - Previous versions of files
- **uncategorized/** - Other unused files

## What Happened?

The Spanish Learning App was consolidated from 71 JavaScript files to 5 core modules:

1. **js/environment.js** - Environment configuration
2. **js/exercise-data.js** - All exercise data (inlined JSON)
3. **js/app-core.js** - Main app + exercise loader + renderer
4. **js/utils.js** - All utilities + accessibility features
5. **js/monitoring.js** - Error and performance monitoring

## Why Were These Files Archived?

These files were not loaded by index.html and are not part of the active codebase.
They may contain:
- Experimental features that were never fully integrated
- Old versions of files that have been updated
- Development and testing tools
- Specialized systems that are not currently used

## Can I Delete These Files?

**Not recommended immediately.** These files contain valuable code that may be:
- Referenced in documentation
- Useful for future features
- Important for understanding the app's development history

Keep this archive for at least 3-6 months before considering permanent deletion.

## Restoring Files

To restore a file from the archive:
1. Copy the file from archive/category/ back to js/
2. Add a script tag to index.html to load it
3. Test thoroughly

## Consolidated Files

The consolidation eliminates:
- ❌ CORS issues with file:// URLs (JSON data now inlined)
- ❌ Module dependency complexity
- ❌ Long load times from multiple script tags

The app now:
- ✅ Loads faster
- ✅ Works offline without server
- ✅ Easy to share as ZIP
- ✅ Double-click index.html to run
